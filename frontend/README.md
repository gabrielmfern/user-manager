# User Manager - Front End

This is the front-end code responsible for interacting with the user data managed by the back-end API.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img width="50%" src="./Screenshot 1.png" alt="Screenshot of the general usage of the listing of the users" /></td>
    <td><img width="50%" src="./Screenshot 2.png" alt="Screenshot of the creation of a user" /></td>
  </tr>
</table>

## What is included in this project?

- User interface using React with TypeScript
- User CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Error handling and user feedback
- Integration with the back-end API built with Flask and Python
- Design using Ant Design library

## How to run?

Before running the front-end, make sure you have the back-end API running on localhost:5000. Then, to run the front-end, you will need to install the dependencies of the project by running the following command:

```sh
npm install
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the following command to start the front-end:

```sh
npm start
```

This will run the front-end in development mode on localhost:3000. To test the functionality of the front-end, you can interact with the user interface and perform CRUD operations on the user data.

## Design

This project uses the Ant Design library for the design of the user interface. You can learn more about Ant Design and its components by visiting their [documentation](https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce).
